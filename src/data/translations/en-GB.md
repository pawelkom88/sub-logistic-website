    items:
      - lead: "Full Truck Load (FTL) transport is a mode of freight in which the vehicle’s entire cargo space is allocated to a single client or shipment."
        text: "The optimal solution for large consignments. The client receives a punctual and secure delivery. No transshipments occur en route."
      - lead: "Less Than Truck Load (LTL) transport—also known as groupage or partial loads—is a mode where a single shipment does not occupy the vehicle’s full cargo space."
        text: "Cost‑effective for smaller volumes. The client benefits from a lower unit cost, paying only for the actual space or weight used. Transshipments occur, and transit time is longer than with full‑truckload transport."
      - lead: "Just‑In‑Time (JIT) transport is a logistics strategy focused on delivering goods precisely when they are needed in production or sales, without the need to hold large inventories."
      - lead: "ADR dangerous goods transport in accordance with the international ADR agreement (Accord Dangereux Routier), which sets out rules for safe packaging, labelling, loading, and carriage."
      - lead: "Cargo insurance—a guarantee that, in the event of unforeseen incidents, the client will not incur financial loss."
        text: "The client gains peace of mind and protection. Applies to shipments by road, sea, air, and rail."
      - lead: "Refrigerated transport—a mode of carriage in controlled, reduced temperature using refrigerated vehicles."
        text: "The aim is to preserve the freshness, quality, and safety of temperature‑sensitive products."
      - lead: "Dedicated transport with a tail lift—door‑to‑door delivery to the client."
        text: "A guarantee of rapid delivery."
      - lead: "Bulk cargo transport—we offer safe and fast haulage of loose materials such as grain, aggregates, sand, cement, and other bulk commodities."
        text: "We use specialised vehicles—tippers, silo trailers, and tankers."
      - lead: "Oversized cargo transport—we carry loads with non‑standard dimensions or weight—from industrial machinery and equipment to steel structures and components of turbines and infrastructure."
        text: "We provide appropriate equipment, the required permits, and, where necessary, road escort."
      - lead: "We provide full support with customs clearance, enabling smooth and hassle‑free import or export of goods across the borders of the European Union."
