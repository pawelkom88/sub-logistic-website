    title: "Our Offer:"
    items:
      - lead: "Full Truck Load (FTL) transport is a mode of freight in which the vehicle’s entire cargo space is allocated to a single client or shipment."
        text: "The optimal solution for large consignments. The client receives a punctual and secure delivery. No transshipments occur en route."
      - lead: "Less Than Truck Load (LTL) transport—also known as groupage or partial loads—is a mode where a single shipment does not occupy the vehicle’s full cargo space."
        text: "Cost‑effective for smaller volumes. The client benefits from a lower unit cost, paying only for the actual space or weight used. Transshipments occur, and transit time is longer than with full‑truckload transport."
      - lead: "Just‑In‑Time (JIT) transport is a logistics strategy focused on delivering goods precisely when they are needed in production or sales, without the need to hold large inventories."
      - lead: "ADR dangerous goods transport in accordance with the international ADR agreement (Accord Dangereux Routier), which sets out rules for safe packaging, labelling, loading, and carriage."
      - lead: "Cargo insurance—a guarantee that, in the event of unforeseen incidents, the client will not incur financial loss."
        text: "The client gains peace of mind and protection. Applies to shipments by road, sea, air, and rail."
      - lead: "Refrigerated transport—a mode of carriage in controlled, reduced temperature using refrigerated vehicles."
        text: "The aim is to preserve the freshness, quality, and safety of temperature‑sensitive products."
      - lead: "Dedicated transport with a tail lift—door‑to‑door delivery to the client."
        text: "A guarantee of rapid delivery."
      - lead: "Bulk cargo transport—we offer safe and fast haulage of loose materials such as grain, aggregates, sand, cement, and other bulk commodities."
        text: "We use specialised vehicles—tippers, silo trailers, and tankers."
      - lead: "Oversized cargo transport—we carry loads with non‑standard dimensions or weight—from industrial machinery and equipment to steel structures and components of turbines and infrastructure."
        text: "We provide appropriate equipment, the required permits, and, where necessary, road escort."
      - lead: "We provide full support with customs clearance, enabling smooth and hassle‑free import or export of goods across the borders of the European Union."

          projects involving full-truckload transport with multiple loading and unloading points.
          This is why our team of logistics experts is committed to continuously analysing and
          optimising routes and transport methods, ensuring that your goods are delivered in the
          most efficient and cost-effective way.

          specific requirements and cargo specifications but also proactively seeks ways to

          to the optimisation of their supply chain.
